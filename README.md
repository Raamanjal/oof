This project focuses on predicting credit scores using machine learning techniques. It involves data preprocessing, feature selection, and training predictive models to assess an individual's creditworthiness accurately. The aim is to assist financial institutions in making smarter lending decisions and reducing credit risk. The dataset is cleaned and transformed to enhance model performance. Various evaluation metrics are used to analyze accuracy and reliability. The code is modular, well-documented, and easy to extend. Users can experiment with different models and parameters. Contributions, suggestions, or improvements are highly encouraged. Feel free to explore, fork the repository, and build upon it.
